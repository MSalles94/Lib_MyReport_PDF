# PDF_REPORT
Sometimes it's useful to create PDF reports, either for printing or virtual distribution. A simple, customized, and standard report is excellent for operational-level information. Typically, this type of document is intended to be issued in large volume in daily routines for employees who don't have access to business intelligence tools or spreadsheets.

This project is a library based on the reportLab and pandas libraries.


## Inspiration

As a business analyst, I needed to generate reports containing the orders placed each day with a high level of detail for many employees. These same employees perform order verification to avoid errors in delivery. As an alternative to the simple report provided by the ERP, I created this library to customize and standardize the daily verification reports.
